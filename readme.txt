== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this secure? =

This does not add any extra risk. If people have access to the account email, they can reset the password, or set up an account with that email anyway.

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Buddypress login on activation, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-buddypress-login-on-activation](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-buddypress-login-on-activation/) . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.

= What if I need some custom buddypress work or a new feature that is not in the plugin?  =
